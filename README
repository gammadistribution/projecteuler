This is a repository chronicling my work on problems from projecteuler.net 
using Python.  

The folder problems contains each individual problem from project euler 
appropriately named.  NOTE: Do not check this folder unless you have attempted
these problems if you intend to complete any such problems on projecteuler.net.

Likewise, modules contains useful modules that I wrote for solving these 
problems.
